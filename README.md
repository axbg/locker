An app meant to simplify encryption and management of regularly updated files... in some particular use-cases.

If a configuration is used often, it can be saved as a *Preference*, by clicking on the *Save Preference* button after a
value for each field is provided.

Then, the preference can be applied afterwards, by selecting it in the *Load preference* dropdown.

If you would like to move your preferences to another PC or share it with somebody else, you can use the
**Export Preferences/Import Preferences** feature.

Your preferences will be encrypted with a password of choice and will be exported to a selected location.

The import process is similar: select the encrypted preferences file and provide the right password, and they will be
added along with your existing preferences.
